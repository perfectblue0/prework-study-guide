# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

To become a better programmer I created this webpage so I could use it as a study guide during bootcamp and refer back to it in the future as well. This will help me remember basic facts about HTML, CSS, Git, and Javascript. In addition, the study guide will be available to anyone that is interested in these topics.

## Usage

To use this Prework Study Guide, you can review the notes in each section. 
For suggestions on what to study first, open the Chrome DevTools by pressing Command+Option+I (macOS) or Control+Shift+I (Windows). A console panel should open either below or to the side of the webpage in the browser. There you will see a list of topics we learned from the prework along with a suggestion on which topic to study first.
